**"One sentence becomes a complete story pitch deck"**
Story outline, characters, world-building, concept art, audio narration, and a downloadable PDF - powered by **IBM Granite**

## The Problem

Creators, writers, indie game designers, tabletop RPG builders, filmmakers have sparks of ideas constantly. Turning a concept into a shareable, presentable pitch takes hours. writing a premise, inventing characters, designing the world, sourcing placeholder art, and formatting it all into something you can hand to a collaborator.

Existing AI tools solve these pieces in isolation across different tabs. Nobody stitches them into one coherent, downloadable creative document automatically.


## The Solution

StoryForge AI takes a single line of user input - e.g. *"A blind cartographer discovers the world is flat"* - and generates a complete, publication-quality **Story Pitch Deck** in under 60 seconds:

## 🎯 Watch It In Action
 


### Step-by-Step Pipeline

<p align="center">

</p>
 
*Clear, real-time Progress on what AI is running at each moment.*

### Fully Generated Pitch Deck

<p align="center">
  <img src="storyforge-ai/assets/gifs/WholePitch.gif" alt="Progress Demo" width="800">
</p>
 

*Watch a complete pitch deck come together in real-time - story, characters, images, and world-building all coherently generated.*

### Per-Section Regeneration
 


<p align="center">
  <img src="storyforge-ai/assets/gifs/textregen.gif" alt="Progress Demo" width="800">
</p>
 
*Don't like a character or the story direction? Click **Regenerate** on any section. The AI re-runs just that step using the current deck as context. One-click **Rollback** if you want to keep the original.*


 ---
### Per-Image Regeneration
 

<p align="center">
  <img src="storyforge-ai/assets/gifs/imageregen.gif" alt="Progress Demo" width="800">
</p>
 
*Hover any of the 4 concept art images → click the regenerate icon. Granite crafts a new art prompt, FLUX generates a new image. Keep or rollback with a single click.*

### One-Click PDF Export
 

<p align="center">
  <img src="storyforge-ai/assets/gifs/exportpdf.gif" alt="Progress Demo" width="800">
</p>
 
*Click **Export PDF** in the header. Your styled, publication-ready pitch deck downloads as A4 with all images, character profiles, world-building, and narration credits.*

| Output | What's generated |
|---|---|
| **Story outline** | Title, logline, premise, three-act structure, theme, tone |
| **3 Character profiles** | Name, role, physical description, backstory, motivation, fatal flaw, defining quote |
| **World building** | Setting name, geography, rules/magic/tech system, cultural flavour, atmosphere |
| **4 Concept art images** | FLUX-generated, described by Granite from the actual story content |
| **Audio narration** | ElevenLabs TTS for each of the 3 acts — voice tuned per genre |
| **PDF export** | Styled A4 pitch deck with all content and images, one-click download |

Everything stays **coherent** — character names, the world name, visual art prompts, and narration all reference the same story, because every step of the AI chain receives the previous outputs as context.

## 🧠 Multi-Agent AI Architecture

StoryForge AI is built as a **multi-agent creative pipeline**. Each specialized AI agent is responsible for one creative task and passes structured output to the next agent, ensuring consistency across the entire pitch deck.

### Why Sequential Chain (not LangGraph)

A sequential chain — prompt 1 → output 1 → prompt 2 that includes output 1 as context — achieves the same coherence as a multi-agent pipeline for this use case. LangGraph adds graph state management and tool registration complexity that buys nothing extra for a solo-built creative generation flow. Simplicity is a feature, the architecture is readable in five minutes and the demo is reliable.

## Feature List

### Core
- **Single-prompt generation** — one sentence generates the full deck
- **8 genre presets** — Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Thriller, Horror, Romance, Historical, Mystery, Adventure
- **Story scope selector** — Short Story, Feature Film, TV Pilot, Video Game, Book Series / Epic
- **Advanced options panel** — Tone, Ending type, Target audience, Setting era (all optional)
- **6-step animated progress bar** — shows exactly which AI is running at each moment
- **Progressive reveal** — each section appears as its data arrives; images load one-by-one
- **Dark mode** — full theme toggle in the header
- **Example prompt chips** — 4 clickable concepts on the landing page for instant demo

### Regenerate & Rollback
- **Per-section regenerate** — Story, Characters, and World each have a Regenerate button; Granite re-runs only that step using the current deck as context
- **Per-image regenerate** — hover any of the 4 concept art images → Regenerate icon; Granite rewrites the art prompt for that slot, then FLUX generates a new image
- **Rollback / Keep UX** — every regeneration (text and image) snapshots the previous version; a "Roll back / Keep new" banner lets you undo with one click
- **Manual audio refresh** — after story regeneration, stale audio is cleared; a "Regenerate Audio" button re-runs ElevenLabs narration for the updated acts

### Landing Page
- **DemoDeck** — a static hardcoded sample pitch deck is visible on the landing page so the output quality is immediately apparent without waiting for a generation

### Audio Narration
- **Per-genre voice profiles** — each genre maps to a distinct ElevenLabs voice (e.g. Thriller → Harry, Fantasy → George, Romance → Sarah)
- **Per-act dynamics** — stability and style parameters are tuned per act (setup vs. conflict vs. resolution)
- **Client-side retry** — two sweeps across the 3 acts with 2-second gaps; eliminates silent acts caused by server-side timeout issues

### Export
- **Styled A4 PDF** — dark header band, amber accent lines, character Wants/Flaw two-column layout, all 4 images in a 2×2 grid, per-page footer
- **Filename derived from title** — e.g. `the-edge-of-everything-pitch-deck.pdf`
